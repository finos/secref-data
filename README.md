# Securities Reference Data Project 

Welcome to the Securities Reference Data project, hosted and led by [FINOS, The Fintech Open Source Foundation](https://www.finos.org). The Securities Reference Data project was launched in 2018 by FINOS member Nomura. 

The project currently has two work streams: **Securities Reference Data** and **Currency Reference Data**.

## Securities Reference Data

### Roadmap
The Securities Reference Data project aims to develop an [open source cloud-based solution to map securities and issuer IDs](https://github.com/finos/secref-data/blob/master/SecRef_%20Securities%20%26%20Issuer%20ID%20mapping_%20.pdf). Doing this once collaboratively has the potential to significantly reduce the costs and effort of maintaining this individually.

For more information see the [Securities Reference Data Roadmap](https://github.com/finos/secref-data/issues/25) .

#### Background
There are a range of trade identifiers used across financial services (ISIN, CUSIP, SEDOL, LEI, FIGI, RIC, BBID and many more) that serve a number of purposes, from validating the integrity of a security to providing common identifiers used during trading and settlement. The majority are either fully or partially â€œclosed" codes, although there are some initiatives that are partially or fully open, like FIGI and OpenCorporates.

However, no single code covers all securities, while individual securities may be represented by multiple identifiers and the granularity of coverage at entity vs. corporate level also varies. This often necessitates costly and error prone mapping across identifiers. The extent of the problem is greater in some asset classes than others and certainly more prominent within the OTC market.
Additionaly, the existence of regionally focused bodies/companies responsible for issuing the identifiers and, in come cases, requiring licenses to access them contributes to the problem, as they minimize the possibility of consolidation onto one identifier, causing delays and reducing transparency. All of these factors impact market efficiency and contribute to trade breaks and errors.

### Get Involved: Contribute to SecRef Data
There are several ways to get involved in SecRef Data:

* **Contribute code** or contribute to **building the mapping table**: reach out to data-tech-sec-ref@finos.org expressing your interest in contributing or [raise an issue](https://github.com/finos/secref-data/issues/new/choose)
* **Contribute use cases** at https://github.com/finos/secref-data/issues/33 
* **Join the mailing list**
Communications for the Securities Reference Data project are conducted through the data-tech-sec-ref@finos.org mailing list. Please email [data-tech-sec-ref+subscribe@finos.org](mailto:data-tech-sec-ref+subscribe@finos.org) to join the mailing list.


All Securities Reference Data project collaboration activities, including [meeting minutes](https://github.com/finos/secref-data/issues?q=label%3Ameeting+),are hosted on this SecRef Data GitHub repo. Activities prior to July 2020 can be found in the Securities Reference Data project [archive](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DT/pages/656834673/Security+Reference+Data+Project).  For more information about FINOS project materials and communication, please review the [FINOS Governance](https://github.com/finos/community/blob/master/governance/Collaborative-Principles.md).


## Currency Reference Data 

### Roadmap
The objective of this work stream is to create a standard object to represent currency data and create a central cloud based repository of the currency data. 
Modeling is being done in the FINOS hosted instance of [Legend Studio](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio), and the current model can be accessed at https://legend.finos.org/studio/viewer/UAT-38 (see screenshot below) Please note that you will need to have an account on the FINOS hosted instance of Legend Studio in order to access it. You can request an account at [finos.org/legend](https://www.finos.org/legend).

For more information see the **[Currency Reference Data Roadmap](https://github.com/finos/secref-data/issues/29)**.

#### Background

The Currency Reference Data work stream spawned off the [Legend Pilot FX Options working group](https://github.com/finos/legend#phase-1-january-2020---september-2020---completed), which identified the need to standardise currency data for several use cases. The ISO Currency code data will be the baseline set of records and attributes which will be enriched with additional attributes and eventually with additional rows for non-ISO currencies and precious metals.  The benefit to the industry would be a single shared source of this reference data that is managed by a group of industry participants.

In an example of cross pollination across FINOS projects, the FX Options working group connected with the Securities Reference Data project and participants from both groups decided to set up a Currency Reference Data work stream. 

### Get Involved: Contribute to CurRef Data
There are several ways to contribute to Currency Reference Data:

* **Join the next meeting**: participants of the Currency Reference Data workstream meet every second Tuesday at 10am ET / 3pm GMT. Find the next meeting on the [FINOS projects calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=finos.org_fac8mo1rfc6ehscg0d80fi8jig@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) and browse [past meeting minutes in GitHub](https://github.com/finos/secref-data/labels/meeting).
* **Join the mailing list**: Communications for the Currency Reference Data project are conducted through the currency-ref-data@finos.org mailing list. Please email [currency-ref-data@finos.org](mailto:currency-ref-data@finos.org) to join the mailing list.
* **Propose changes to the model**: request an account on the FINOS Legend Studio hosted instance at [finos.org/legend](https://www.finos.org/legend) in order to access the model at https://legend.finos.org/studio/viewer/UAT-38
* **Contribute use cases** at https://github.com/finos/secref-data/issues/30
* **Raise an issue**: if you have any questions or suggestions, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/finos/secref-data/issues/new/choose)
